For this project, I'll be using data from the Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/).
The API is very in-depth, showing almost everything you need to know about a specified Pokemon. It is structured in a JSON format.
Aside from the Pokemon themselves, it also contains information on other aspects of the Pokemon world, such as items, types, the different generations of games, and much more.
For this project, I want to keep things relatively simple. So I'll have my data based around the first generation of 151 Pokemon, and their 16 different types.
Three database tables will be used. A table for Pokemon, with and ID, Name, and imagelink column. A table for Types with ID, and name column.
And finally, a table to join the two together.
The joiner table (titled PokeTypes) will contain an ID, and two Foreign keys, detailing the Pokemon, and the type they belong to.
The reason for the Poketype table existing is that a Pokemon can have up to two types, and types can have up to hundreds of Pokemon. A one-to-many relationship.
